# **Early Detection of Parkinson's Disease Through Vocal Feature Analysis**

This repository contains the code and analysis for the FODS (CS F320) course project by Group 13 on Topic 13\.

## **Project Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to develop a non-invasive and accessible screening tool for the early detection of Parkinson's disease (PD). By analyzing biomedical voice measurements, this tool aims to identify potential indicators of the disease, enabling individuals to seek timely medical consultation.

## **Files**

* **FODS\_EDA.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook containing all exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, outlier removal, and PCA.  
* **train\_parkinsons.py**: The main Python script to replicate the entire project. It loads the data, scales it, performs hyperparameter tuning on all 8 models (including XGBoost and a PyTorch-based ANN), evaluates them, and saves all results.  
* **parkinsons\_model.pkl**: The final, saved **Random Forest** model, chosen for its high F1-Score and AUC-ROC.  
* **scaler.pkl**: The StandardScaler object that was fit on the training data, required for the web demo.  
* **parkinsons\_analysis\_results\_gridsearch/**: This folder contains all output artifacts (plots, reports, and CSVs) generated by train\_parkinsons.py.  
* **Final\_Report.pdf**: A detailed report summarizing the project's findings, methodology, and conclusions.

## **How to Replicate the Work**

### **1. Setup**

You will need Python 3 and the following libraries. Install them via pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib streamlit xgboost torch skorch
```
### **2. Run the Main Analysis**

This script will load the primary dataset (`parkinsons.data`) from the UCI repository, train all 8 models, and generate all plots and reports in the `parkinsons_analysis_results_gridsearch/` directory.

```bash
python train_parkinsons.py
```
* **Model:** **Random Forest**  
* **Test Set F1-Score:** **0.9396**  
* **Test Set AUC-ROC:** **0.9718**

The Random Forest model was chosen for its superior F1-Score and AUC-ROC, indicating the best balance of precision/recall and the most robust ability to distinguish between healthy and Parkinson's patients.
